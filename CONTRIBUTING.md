# Contribution



Below is a list of issues that need some help. There are three lists; advanced issues, intermediate issues, and starter issues. Starter issues are issues that can be picked up and worked on without too much hassle or setup. Intermediate issues may require some digging. Advanced issues likely require a lot of work.



## Starter Issues

- Add reversed type info for PS4 library function prototypes in `/include/orbis/*`
- Submit issues for requested features
- Build some basic samples for functionality not covered by existing samples



## Intermediate Issues

- Testing on `create-lib` to ensure exporting and what not works properly
- SDL 2D sample
- Develop MiraLib bindings for other languages



## Advanced Issues

- Build a standardized libc for PS4 for portability and eventually C++ support
- C++ support (see above)
- GPU 2D/3D rendering support
- DOOM port?



More issues will be added here as more are requested. If you think something should be here that isn't, feel free to file an issue!
