This installer will install the OpenOrbis PS4 Toolchain to a location of your choosing, and will automatically setup the OO_PS4_TOOLCHAIN environment variable all the build scripts reference.

Some samples are included in /OpenOrbis-PS4-Toolchain/samples and you can find some docs too at /OpenOrbis-PS4-Toolchain/docs.

OpenOrbis PS4 Toolchain does also require you to have copy of LLVM installed, which can be installed by their pre-built binary installers at releases.llvm.org/download.html. Python 3 is optional but recommended if you want to run scripts in /scripts.
